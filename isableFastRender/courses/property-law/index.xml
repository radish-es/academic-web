      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;our-approach-in-this-course&#34;&gt;Our Approach in this Course&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our approach in this course is to analyze legal arguments closely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;harrison-v-carswell-1976-2-scr-200&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Harrison v Carswell&lt;/em&gt;, [1976] 2 SCR 200&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;comment&#34;&gt;&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;Before you get started...&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Harrison v Carswell&lt;/em&gt; is our first case of the year and we are going to spend considerable time reading and working through the arguments, the competing judicial styles, and the broader context of the case. While the case introduces some core legal concepts our main reason for studying it is to develop a clear methodology for reading law in this course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep an eye out for these key thematic questions: (1) How is private property different from public property, i.e. what is the boundary between them? (2) When, if ever, should property rights “trump” other rights and freedoms? (3) What is the proper role of judicial precedent?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Key concepts include: &lt;em&gt;possession&lt;/em&gt;; &lt;em&gt;trespass&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;the right to exclude&lt;/em&gt;; &lt;em&gt;privacy&lt;/em&gt;; &lt;em&gt;economy&lt;/em&gt;; and &lt;em&gt;stare decisis&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first paragraph of Justice Dickson’s judgement is fairly succinct, but there is a lot packed into this paragraph. Before moving on, make sure you are clear on the basics before moving on to the reasoning in the case.*What was the charge brought against Sophie Carswell? Notice that Justice Dickson does not actually describe what Carswell was doing at the mall. &lt;em&gt;Why leave out this crucial fact?&lt;/em&gt; What is the procedural history of the case before it gets to the Supreme Court? Does Carswell win or lose in the courts below?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, before continuing to read the rest of the judgement closely, skim ahead quickly to get a sense of where all this is going, then come back here. &lt;em&gt;What do Justices Dickson and Laskin, respectively, want the outcome of the case to be?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSciyj5SF8rslwbD1OnV7JuOhTFuNlFwH3HxrN0r5XaARULADw/viewform?embedded=true&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; height=&#34;706&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; marginheight=&#34;0&#34; marginwidth=&#34;0&#34;&gt;Loading…&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[1] The respondent, Sophie Carswell, was charged under &lt;span data-text=&#34;The relevant provision reads: 1(1) … (b) who enters or in any way trespasses upon lands or premises that are the property of another and are not wholly enclosed, after being requested by the owner, tenant or occupier not to do so, or who, having entered the lands or premises or committed the trespass, refuses to leave upon being requested by the owner, tenant or occupier to do so; is guilty of an offence, whether or not any damage has been occasioned by the entry or trespass, and is liable on summary conviction to a fine of not more than $5,000.&#34; class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Petty Trespasses Act&lt;/em&gt;, R.S.M. 1970, c. P50&lt;/span&gt;, with four offences (one on each of four days) of unlawfully trespassing upon the premises of the Fairview Corporation Limited, trading under the firm name and style of Polo Park Shopping Centre, located in the City of Winnipeg, after having been requested by the owner not to enter on or come upon the premises. The appellant, Peter Harrison, manager of Polo Park Shopping Centre, swore the informations. The charges were dismissed by the Provincial Judge but on a trial de novo in the County Court Mrs. Carswell was convicted and fined $10 on each of the charges. The convictions were set aside by the Manitoba Court of Appeal [1974] 4 W.W.R. 394 (Freedman C.J.M. and Matas J.A., with Guy J.A. dissenting) and the present appeal followed by leave of this Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;comment&#34;&gt;&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;Dickson&#39;s first set of arguments.&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, Dickson is going to start by focusing on the role of PRECEDENT. Somewhat unusually in this case, there was another case with some similar facts that came before the Supreme Court just a few years before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;audio controls&gt;&lt;source src=&#34;https://www.dropbox.com/s/45hdtv2mzcwvv1l/test.mp3?raw=1&#34; type=&#34;audio/mpeg&#34;&gt;&lt;/audio&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[2] With great respect, I am unable to agree with the majority reasons, delivered in the Court of Appeal by Freedman C.J.M., for I find it difficult, indeed impossible, to make any well-founded distinction between this case and &lt;em&gt;Peters v. The Queen&lt;/em&gt; (1971), 2 C.C.C. (2d) 339n, 17 D.L.R. (3d) 128, decided by this Court four years ago in a unanimous decision of the full bench. The constitutional issue raised in &lt;em&gt;Peters&lt;/em&gt; no longer concerns us; the only other issue was whether the owner of a shopping plaza had sufficient control or possession of the common areas, having regard to the unrestricted invitation to the public to enter upon the premises, as to enable it to invoke the remedy of trespass. The Court decided it did. That case and the present case came to us on much the same facts; picketing within a shopping centre in connection with a labour dispute. In &lt;em&gt;Peters&lt;/em&gt; the picketing was carried out by the president of the Brampton Labour Council and seven other persons, carrying placards and distributing leaflets in front of a Safeway store, seeking a boycott of Safeway for selling California grapes. In the present case the picketing was carried out by Mrs. Carswell and 11 other persons carrying placards and distributing leaflets in front of the premises of their employer, Dominion Stores. In both instances the picketing was peaceful. Although the question posed in &lt;em&gt;Peters&lt;/em&gt; did not recite the facts upon which the case rested, the question was worded thus:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did the learned Judges in Appeal err in law in determining that &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; owner of &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; property had sufficient possession of &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; shopping plaza sidewalk to be capable of availing itself of the remedy for trespass under The Petty Trespass Act, R.S.O. 1960, Chapter 294, Section 1(1)? (The italics are mine.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[3] In my view it is so expressed, with repeated use of the definite article, as to relate the question to the circumstances in respect of which the Judges made their determination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[4] The judgment of the Ontario Court of Appeal in &lt;em&gt;Peters&lt;/em&gt;, [1971] 1 O.R. 597, 2 C.C.C. (2d) 336, 16 D.L.R. (3d) 143:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With respect to the first ground of appeal, it is our opinion that an owner who has granted a right of entry to a particular class of the public has not thereby relinquished his or its right to withdraw its invitation to the general public or any particular member thereof, and that if a member of the public whose invitation to enter has been withdrawn refuses to leave, he thereby becomes a trespasser and may be prosecuted under the &lt;em&gt;Petty Trespass Act&lt;/em&gt; [R.S.O. 1960, c. 294 (now R.S.O. 1970, c. 347)]. Here, the invitation extended by the owner was of a general nature and included tenants, employees, agents and all persons having or seeking business relations with the tenants. However, notwithstanding the general nature of the invitation, the owner did not thereby lose its right to withdraw the invitation from the general public or any particular member thereof. In addition, it is also our view with respect to trespass that possession does not cease to be exclusive so long as there is the right to control entry of the general public, and here the owner had not relinquished that right of control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[5] The brief judgment in this Court, answering in the negative the question asked, neither adopted nor repudiated the reasons delivered in the Court of Appeal but it should not be overlooked that when the &lt;em&gt;Peters&lt;/em&gt; case was before the Ontario Court of Appeal, counsel for Peters relied upon the decision of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan in &lt;em&gt;Grosvenor Park Shopping Centre Ltd. v. Waloshin&lt;/em&gt; (1964), 49 W.W.R. 237, 46 D.L.R. (2d) 750. That case arose out of injunction proceedings during a strike of employees of Loblaw Groceterias Co. Ltd. in Saskatoon who were picketing with placards on the sidewalks adjacent to store premises located in a shopping centre. The pertinent part of the judgment of the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal reads [p. 755]:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learned counsel for the appellant argued that the respondent did not have that degree of possession essential to an action in trespass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The area upon which it is alleged the appellants have trespassed is part of what is well known as a shopping centre. While legal title to the area is in the respondent, it admits in its pleadings that it has granted easements to the many tenants. The evidence also establishes that the respondent has extended an unrestricted invitation to the public to enter upon the premises. The very nature of the operation is one in which the respondent, both in its own interests and in the interests of its tenants, could not do otherwise. Under these circumstances, it cannot be said that the respondent is in actual possession. The most that can be said is that the respondent exercises control over the premises but does not exercise that control to the exclusion of other persons. For that reason, therefore, the respondent cannot maintain an action in trespass against the appellants: &lt;em&gt;vide&lt;/em&gt; 38 Hals., 3rd ed., p. 743, para. 1212. Support, too, for this view may be found in &lt;em&gt;Zeller&amp;rsquo;s (Western) Ltd. v. Retail Food &amp;amp; Drug Clerks Union, Local 1518&lt;/em&gt; (1963), 45 W.W.R. 337, 42 D.L.R. (2d) 582 (B.C. C.A.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[6] Gale C.J.O., in &lt;em&gt;Peters&lt;/em&gt;, offered this observation with respect to &lt;em&gt;Grosvenor Park&lt;/em&gt;, supra [p. 146]:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solicitor for the appellant relied very heavily upon a decision of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan in &lt;em&gt;Grosvenor Park Shopping Centre Ltd. v. Waloshin&lt;/em&gt; [supra]. If our view in this appeal does not harmonize with the reasoning of the Court in the &lt;em&gt;Grosvenor Park&lt;/em&gt; case, we must respectfully disagree with that reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[7] So when the &lt;em&gt;Peters&lt;/em&gt; case came to this Court for consideration the Court had before it the reasoning of the Court of Appeal for Ontario in that case and the reasoning, difficult to reconcile, of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan in &lt;em&gt;Grosvenor Park&lt;/em&gt;; the reasoning of the Ontario Court prevailed. There has been no suggestion that &lt;em&gt;Peters&lt;/em&gt; was wrongly decided; therefore, I would think it must be regarded as controlling unless it can properly be distinguished from the case at bar. No distinction can be made on the ground of contract; there is a copy of the lease from Fairview to Dominion Stores among the papers but it would not appear, nor has it been argued, that any distinction can rest on that document. As to a possible statutory distinction, the Petty Trespass Acts of Manitoba and Ontario do not differ in any material respect and indeed s. 24 of The Labour Relations Act, 1972 (Man.), c. 75, specifically preserves rights against trespassers. Therefore it would seem that the appeal must succeed unless a valid distinction can be drawn on the ground that the president of the Brampton Labour Council in &lt;em&gt;Peters&lt;/em&gt; was a mere member of the general public from whom permission to remain on the premises could be withdrawn at will, whereas Mrs. Carswell was an employee of one of the tenants of the shopping centre on strike in support of a current labour dispute from whom permission to remain on the premises could not, as a matter of law, be withdrawn. I find myself unable to accept that any ground in law supports such a distinction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[8] The evidence discloses that distribution of pamphlets or leaflets in the mall of Polo Park Shopping Centre or on the parking lot has never been permitted by the management of the centre and that this prohibition has extended to tenants of the centre. The centre, as a matter of policy, has not permitted any person to walk in the mall carrying placards. There is nothing in the evidence supporting the view that in the present case the owner of the centre was acting out of caprice or whimsy or mala fides. In a comment entitled &amp;ldquo;Labour Law — Picketing on Shopping Centres&amp;rdquo; (1965), 43 Can. Bar Rev. 357 at 362, H. W. Arthurs referred to the following as one of the legitimate concerns of the landlord of a shopping centre:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;… while public authorities may, on behalf of the community, strike a reasonable balance between traffic and picketing on public sidewalks and streets, the shopping centre owner can hardly be expected to make such a choice; he has no authority to speak for the community; to grant picketing or parading privileges to all would invite chaos, while to do so selectively would invite commercial reprisals. He is thus driven to adopt a highly restrictive approach to granting permission to groups who wish to parade or picket in the shopping centre.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;comment&#34;&gt;&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;Dickson&#39;s second set of arguments.&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To this point, Dickson has focused his attention on &lt;em&gt;Peters&lt;/em&gt; and the role of binding precedent. Now watch: he is going to shift gears into a different set of arguments. Can you detect the shift?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/pPpI8NHb2fo&#34; width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;316&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/details&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt; It is urged on behalf of Mrs. Carswell that the right of a person to picket peacefully in support of a lawful strike is of greater social significance than the proprietary rights of an owner of a shopping centre and that the rights of the owner must yield to those of the picketer. The American example has been cited but I cannot say that I find the American cases to which we have been referred of great help. The facts in &lt;em&gt;Schwartz-Torrance Investment Corpn. v. Bakery and Confectionery Workers&#39; Union, Local 31&lt;/em&gt; (1964), 394 P. 2d 921, 85 S. Ct. 888, decided by the Supreme Court of California, are almost identical with those in &lt;em&gt;Grosvenor Park&lt;/em&gt; but I think it not unimportant to note that in &lt;em&gt;Schwartz-Torrance&lt;/em&gt; Tobriner J., early in his judgment, drew attention to the fact that the Legislature of the State of California had expressly declared that the public policy of the state favoured concerted activities of employees for the purpose of collective bargaining and had enacted the policy into an exception to the criminal trespass law. Construing that exception, the California Supreme Court in a case antedating &lt;em&gt;Schwartz-Torrance&lt;/em&gt; had concluded that the Legislature, in dealing with trespasses, had specifically subordinated the rights of the property owner to those of persons engaged in lawful labour activities. &lt;em&gt;Schwartz-Torrance&lt;/em&gt; is, therefore, of small aid in this case and indeed can be said to support, in a negative sense, a position inimical to that of Mrs. Carswell. And one need only read &lt;em&gt;Amalgamated Food Employees&#39; Union, Local 590 v. Logan Valley Plaza Inc.&lt;/em&gt; (1968), 391 U.S. 308, and then read &lt;em&gt;Lloyd Corpn. v. Tanner&lt;/em&gt; (1972), 407 U.S. 551, 92 S. Ct. 2219, to apprehend the uncertainties and very real difficulties which emerge when a court essays to legislate as to what is and what is not a permissible activity within a shopping centre.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-note-on-method&#34;&gt;A note on method&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Method is important…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;harrison-v-carswell-1976-2-scr-200&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Harrison v Carswell&lt;/em&gt;, [1976] 2 SCR 200&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[1] The respondent, Sophie Carswell, was charged under &lt;span data-text=&#34;The relevant provision reads: 1(1) … (b) who enters or in any way trespasses upon lands or premises that are the property of another and are not wholly enclosed, after being requested by the owner, tenant or occupier not to do so, or who, having entered the lands or premises or committed the trespass, refuses to leave upon being requested by the owner, tenant or occupier to do so; is guilty of an offence, whether or not any damage has been occasioned by the entry or trespass, and is liable on summary conviction to a fine of not more than $5,000.&#34; class=&#34;tooltip&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Petty Trespasses Act&lt;/em&gt;, R.S.M. 1970, c.

&lt;p&gt;[3] In my view it is so expressed, with repeated use of the definite article, as to relate the question to the circumstances in respect of which the Judges made their determination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[4] The judgment of the Ontario Court of Appeal in &lt;em&gt;Peters&lt;/em&gt;, [1971] 1 O.R. 597, 2 C.C.C. (2d) 336, 16 D.L.R. (3d) 143:&lt;/p&gt;

Therefore it would seem that the appeal must succeed unless a valid distinction can be drawn on the ground that the president of the Brampton Labour Council in &lt;em&gt;Peters&lt;/em&gt; was a mere member of the general public from whom permission to remain on the premises could be withdrawn at will, whereas Mrs. Carswell was an employee of one of the tenants of the shopping centre on strike in support of a current labour dispute from whom permission to remain on the premises could not, as a matter of law, be withdrawn. I find myself unable to accept that any ground in law supports such a distinction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[8] The evidence discloses that distribution of pamphlets or leaflets in the mall of Polo Park Shopping Centre or on the parking lot has never been permitted by the management of the centre and that this prohibition has extended to tenants of the centre. The centre, as a matter of policy, has not permitted any person to walk in the mall carrying placards. There is nothing in the evidence supporting the view that in the present case the owner of the centre was acting out of caprice or whimsy or mala fides. In a comment entitled &amp;ldquo;Labour Law — Picketing on Shopping Centres&amp;rdquo; (1965), 43 Can. Bar Rev. 357 at 362, H. W. Arthurs referred to the following as one of the legitimate concerns of the landlord of a shopping centre:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;… while public authorities may, on behalf of the community, strike a reasonable balance between traffic and picketing on public sidewalks and streets, the shopping centre owner can hardly be expected to make such a choice; he has no authority to speak for the community; to grant picketing or parading privileges to all would invite chaos, while to do so selectively would invite commercial reprisals. He is thus driven to adopt a highly restrictive approach to granting permission to groups who wish to parade or picket in the shopping centre.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt; It is urged on behalf of Mrs. Carswell that the right of a person to picket peacefully in support of a lawful strike is of greater social significance than the proprietary rights of an owner of a shopping centre and that the rights of the owner must yield to those of the picketer. The American example has been cited but I cannot say that I find the American cases to which we have been referred of great help. The facts in &lt;em&gt;Schwartz-Torrance Investment Corpn. v. Bakery and Confectionery Workers&#39; Union, Local 31&lt;/em&gt; (1964), 394 P. 2d 921, 85 S. Ct. 888, decided by the Supreme Court of California, are almost identical with those in &lt;em&gt;Grosvenor Park&lt;/em&gt; but I think it not unimportant to note that in &lt;em&gt;Schwartz-Torrance&lt;/em&gt; Tobriner J., early in his judgment, drew attention to the fact that the Legislature of the State of California had expressly declared that the public policy of the state favoured concerted activities of employees for the purpose of collective bargaining and had enacted the policy into an exception to the criminal trespass law. Construing that exception, the California Supreme Court in a case antedating &lt;em&gt;Schwartz-Torrance&lt;/em&gt; had concluded that the Legislature, in dealing with trespasses, had specifically subordinated the rights of the property owner to those of persons engaged in lawful labour activities. &lt;em&gt;Schwartz-Torrance&lt;/em&gt; is, therefore, of small aid in this case and indeed can be said to support, in a negative sense, a position inimical to that of Mrs. Carswell. And one need only read &lt;em&gt;Amalgamated Food Employees&#39; Union, Local 590 v. Logan Valley Plaza Inc.&lt;/em&gt; (1968), 391 U.S. 308, and then read &lt;em&gt;Lloyd Corpn. v. Tanner&lt;/em&gt; (1972), 407 U.S. 551, 92 S. Ct. 2219, to apprehend the uncertainties and very real difficulties which emerge when a court essays to legislate as to what is and what is not a permissible activity within a shopping centre.&lt;/p&gt;
