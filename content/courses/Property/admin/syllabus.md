This document is the 202X-XX course syllabus for ***Property in its Historical Context*** (LAWS 1005), taught by [Professor Jamie Baxter](https://www.dal.ca/faculty/law/faculty-staff/our-faculty/jamie-baxter.html), at the [Schulich School of Law, Dalhousie University](https://www.dal.ca/faculty/law.html).

## General Information

### Contact Details

Please contact me by e-mail ([jamie.baxter@dal.ca](mailto:jamie.baxter@dal.ca)) about any matters or questions related to the course. My office is Room 326 Weldon. 

### Administration

Information on all course requirements, procedures and schedules is contained in this [Course Syllabus](../syllabus), the [Course Schedule](../schedule), and [Reading List](../reading-list). All of these documents are available in the [Administration](../) section of the course website. 

The [Course Schedule](../schedule) and [Reading List](../reading-list) may be amended during the term as needed. Please refer to the online versions of these documents (rather than print-outs or local copies) for the most up-to-date information.

### Class Meeting Schedule

Please see the online [Course Schedule](../schedule) for details about class meeting dates, times and locations.

### In-person Appointments

If you have questions about the course material, please come to see me in my office. As a general policy, I won't answer substantive questions about the course material by e-mail. This policy exists mainly to avoid a flood of last minute e-mails before exams, but it also pushes you to plan ahead in your studying. To get the most out of in-person appointments, plan to dedicate some time to ongoing review of the course content during the term  and contact me with your questions as they arise. I know that this can be a challenge as the term gets busy, but the benefits of even 20 or 30 mins of periodic review will surprise you.

You should send questions you'd like to discuss during office hours via email to [jamie.baxter@dal.ca](mailto:jamie.baxter@dal.ca) at least one hour prior to the drop-in session you plan to attend. This lets me know that you are coming, and gives me a chance to think through your questions ahead of time.

I am also happy to schedule small group meetings if you'd like to meet in this format -- please e-mail to arrange a time.

<!--The last day for fall term office hours will be **Thursday, December 5**. The last day for winter term office hours will be **Monday, April 6**. Group Q&A sessions are scheduled to address questions in advance of exams (see [Course Schedule](./schedule).-->

### E-Mail Communications

All communication from me to you about the course will be via an Announcement posted on [Brightspace](http://dal.brightspace.com). Please ensure that you have e-mail notifications enabled for Brightspace Announcements — this way, you will receive a copy of each announcement in your inbox when it is posted. I will assume that you have received and read all course information sent by this route. 

All e-mail messages to me about the course should include in the subject line the course name and a concise statement of purpose (e.g. Property: Missed class). Please remember that e-mail is not an alternative to meeting with me in-person using the procedure described above if you have questions about the course content.

### Course Website and Course Materials

All materials for this course are available online at [www.opensourcelaw/courses/property](www.opensourcelaw.com/courses/property). The materials are free to access; you do not need to purchase any required materials for the course. 

Required readings for the course are assigned on a weekly basis — please consult the [Course Schedule](../schedule). Online versions of the weekly readings, posted on the course website, contain interactive elements (instructional notes, podcasts, screencasts, quizzes, etc), so please aim to read these materials on your computer or tablet when possible. However, I realize that this format may not suit everyone for all purposes. Each assigned reading is also available on the website in multiple formats (Rich Text, Microsoft Word, Adobe PDF) for you to download, to markup, to add your own notes, and/or to use to make your own summaries. 

These course materials have been created and published using an open-source model. This means that all materials — including the website platform on which they're published — are available to anyone to access, copy, redistribute, remix, and build upon under the [Creative Commons BY-NC-SA 4.0 licence](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/). 

### Class Slides

I will use slides in most class meetings, but please do not expect these to be a substitute for taking your own notes in class. My slides are designed to give some visual structure to our class meetings, but they are not content heavy. You can access a link to the slides on the course website under the main heading for each set of weekly readings. 

## Course Goals and Expectations

My goal in this course is for you to learn to think "like a lawyer", and in doing so to critically analyze the limits and possibilities of legal thought/practice in the context of property.

This goal of "thinking like a lawyer" likely sounds similar to goals in your other courses this year. But the way we will approach that goal in this course may look quite different. In this course, you will certainly need to learn some basic rules of property law and the basic skills of making legal arguments using those rules. But you will also need to go beyond the rules and arguments by situating them in structures and styles of legal thought (we will spend a lot of time working through exactly how these "structures" and "styles" work throughout the course). Doing all this will require you — as the course title suggests — to develop an understanding of legal history — namely, how both our rules and patterns of legal thought have changed and are changing over time. 

Learning all this is hard work and this means that I have high expectations for your performance—both in class and on exams. I demand a lot from you because I want to prepare you as professionals, whether in law or in other pursuits. I value the diversity of experience and insight that you bring to studying law and I believe that each of you can meet these expectations and do the work. I am here to coach you through the process.

### Class Preparation, Meetings and Methods

Your preparation for, attendance and active engagement in class is crucial for succeeding in this course. We have a limited time each week to spend together, and you are all very busy people. We want to ensure that we use the time together as effectively as possible. 

For each class meeting I expect you to:

- Be in class.

- Be well prepared, having worked through the online materials in advance of the first class each week.

- Focus your attention on the material and limit any distractions as much as possible.

- Participate actively in class discussions and exercises.

We will use a variety of teaching/learning methods to achieve the goals for this course, to keep things interesting, and to accomodate various learning styles. I ask for you patience if/when I am using a style that works for others, but not for you.

### Professional Engagement in Law School

However you decide to make use of your law degree, you will inevitably start to build your professional practice and reputation in law school. I want your experience in this course to be about building these in a good way. 

This includes paying attention and responding to what others say as well as working with others to collectively learn the material. Please be prepared for class and to be ready to work. Please listen to others, avoid dominating discussion, take the initiative to improve your skills, take risks and be resourceful. Please seek help when you realize you need it or when recommended. Please show up every day on time and stay in class the whole time. If you have questions about this, please contact me.

If you are unable to attend class, please notify me by e-mail before class, if at all possible. 

You are responsible for learning information and getting the handouts provided in class or made available online. If you missed class, talk to classmates to learn what happened and get notes.

When you are in class, please be prepared to participate in the discussion and to *engage*. Being “prepared” does not mean you have become an expert on the material; it does mean that you will have understood the learning objectives for each class, read and thought about the assigned materials, worked through any problems or prompt questions, and be ready to engage and discuss this work with others. You will not be penalized for asking what you might think are bad questions or letting me know when you are confused. You are responsible, however, for asking questions when you do not understand material. 

## Evaluation

You will be evaluated in this course based on examinations. In December, there will be a ‘fail-safe’ exam. If you get a higher mark on your April exam, your April mark will be your final mark. If you get a higher mark on your December exam, the December mark will count for 30% of your final grade. The December and April exams are both open book.

All examinations will be written on computer. Further information will be sent to students from the Associate Dean’s Office. Rules governing exams are included in the *Academic Calendar*.

## Accommodations

Requests for special accommodation for reasons such as illness, injury or family emergency will require an application to the Law School Studies Committee. Such requests (for example, exam deferrals) must be made to the Director of Student Services and Engagement as soon as possible, before a scheduled exam or a deadline for an assignment, and will generally require documentation. **Retroactive accommodation will not be provided.** Please note that individual professors cannot entertain accommodation requests. Students are expected to use the appropriate form when making such requests. Forms are available in hard copy in W222 or on the law school website. Please note that your request for accommodation is not approved until you receive written confirmation.

Students may request accommodation for either classroom participation or the writing of tests and exams due to barriers related to disability, religious obligation, or any characteristic under the *Nova Scotia Human Rights Act*. Students who require such accommodation must make their request to the Student Accessibility Center (SAC) at the outset of the regular academic year. Please visit [www.dal.ca/access](www.dal.ca/access) for more information and to obtain the *Request for Accommodation – Form A*. Students may also contact the Student Accessibility Center by phone at (902) 494-2836.

## Plagiarism

All students must read the University policies on plagiarism and academic honesty at [http://academicintegrity.dal.ca/](http://academicintegrity.dal.ca/) and the Law School policy on plagiarism at [http://www.dal.ca/faculty/law/current-students/jd-students/academic-regulations.html](http://www.dal.ca/faculty/law/current-students/jd-students/academic-regulations.html). Any paper or assignment submitted by a student at the Schulich School of Law may be checked for originality to confirm that the student has not plagiarized from other sources. Plagiarism is considered a serious academic offence which may lead to loss of credit, suspension or expulsion from the law school, or even revocation of a degree. It is essential that there be correct attribution of authorities from which facts and opinions have been derived. Prior to submitting any paper or other assignment, students should read and familiarize themselves with the policies referred to above and should consult with the instructor if they have any questions. Ignorance of the policies on plagiarism will not excuse any violation of those policies.

## Inclusive Classroom

Dalhousie University is committed to a welcoming and respectful working and learning environment that is free from harassment and discrimination. We encourage open dialogue, however members of the class are expected to refrain from speaking or behaving in ways that are harmful to others, through racism, homophobia, sexism, or other derogatory treatment based on characteristics protected under the Nova Scotia *Human Rights Act*. Please do not hesitate to speak with me if you have questions or concerns, or see [https://www.dal.ca/cultureofrespect.html](https://www.dal.ca/cultureofrespect.html) for further information on resources and supports.

## Recordings

You are not permitted to record class meetings. The unauthorized use of any form of device to audiotape, photograph, video-record or otherwise reproduce lectures is prohibited. Students must obtain prior written consent to any such recording. Exceptions may be granted in cases of private use for reason of accommodation.
